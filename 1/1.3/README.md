* Amazon Kinesis Data Streams: You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process large streams of data records in real time. Kinesis Data Streams is part of the Kinesis streaming data platform, along with Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Video Streams, and Kinesis Data Analytics.

* Amazon MQ: Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ that makes it easy to migrate to a message broker in the cloud. A message broker allows software applications and components to communicate using various programming languages, operating systems, and formal messaging protocols.

* Amazon SWF: The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your application. Coordinating tasks across the application involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.
