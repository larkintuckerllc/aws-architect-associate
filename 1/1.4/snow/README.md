# AWS Snow Family

## Concepts

> AWS Snowcone is a portable, rugged, and secure device for edge computing and data transfer. You can use Snowcone to collect, process, and move data to AWS, either offline by shipping the device to AWS, or online by using AWS DataSync.

&nbsp;

> It can be challenging to run applications in austere (non-data center) edge environments, or where there is a lack of consistent network connectivity. These locations often lack the space, power, and cooling needed for data center IT equipment. With two CPUs and 8 TB of storage, Snowcone can run edge computing workloads that use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, and store data securely.

> The AWS Snowball Edge is a type of Snowball device with on-board storage and compute power for select AWS capabilities. Snowball Edge can undertake local processing and edge-computing workloads in addition to transferring data between your local environment and the AWS Cloud.

> The AWS Snowball service uses physical storage devices to transfer large amounts of data between Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and your onsite data storage location at faster-than-internet speeds. By working with AWS Snowball, you can save time and money. Snowball provides powerful interfaces that you can use to create jobs, track data, and track the status of your jobs through to completion.
