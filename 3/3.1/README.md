* AWS Single Sign-On

> AWS Single Sign-On is a cloud-based single sign-on (SSO) service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to all of your AWS accounts and cloud applications. Specifically, it helps you manage SSO access and user permissions across all your AWS accounts in AWS Organizations. AWS SSO also helps you manage access and permissions to commonly used third-party software as a service (SaaS) applications, AWS SSO-integrated applications as well as custom applications that support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0

> AWS Directory Service provides multiple ways to use Microsoft Active Directory (AD) with other AWS services. Directories store information about users, groups, and devices, and administrators use them to manage access to information and resources. AWS Directory Service provides multiple directory choices for customers who want to use existing Microsoft AD or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)â€“aware applications in the cloud. It also offers those same choices to developers who need a directory to manage users, groups, devices, and access.

**notes**: A Cloud Guru:

* AWS Managed Microsoft AD: AD Controllers with AD trust

* Simple AD (small or large): AD Controllers without AD trust

* AD Connector: Connecting on-premise services using AD

> Amazon Cloud Directory is a highly available multi-tenant directory-based store in AWS. These directories scale automatically to hundreds of millions of objects as needed for applications. This lets operation's staff focus on developing and deploying applications that drive the business, not managing directory infrastructure. Unlike traditional directory systems, Cloud Directory does not limit organizing directory objects in a single fixed hierarchy.

> A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With a user pool, your users can sign in to your web or mobile app through Amazon Cognito. Your users can also sign in through social identity providers like Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Apple, and through SAML identity providers. Whether your users sign in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).
