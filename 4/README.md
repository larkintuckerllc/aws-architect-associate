> AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; AWS CloudFormation handles all of that.

> The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework that you can use to build serverless applications on AWS.

&nbsp;

> AWS SAM template specification. You use this specification to define your serverless application.
