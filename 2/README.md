> AWS Auto Scaling enables you to configure automatic scaling for the AWS resources that are part of your application in a matter of minutes. The AWS Auto Scaling console provides a single user interface to use the automatic scaling features of multiple AWS services. You can configure automatic scaling for individual resources or for whole applications.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups: Launch or terminate EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.

Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet requests: Launch or terminate instances from a Spot Fleet request, or automatically replace instances that get interrupted for price or capacity reasons.

Amazon ECS: Adjust the ECS service desired count up or down in response to load variations.

Amazon DynamoDB: Enable a DynamoDB table or a global secondary index to increase or decrease its provisioned read and write capacity to handle increases in traffic without throttling.

Amazon Aurora: Dynamically adjust the number of Aurora read replicas provisioned for an Aurora DB cluster to handle changes in active connections or workload.
